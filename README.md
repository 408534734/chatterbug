Communication Proxies
===========

Set of communication-only codes that mimic commonly found communication patterns
in HPC codes. These codes can be used as synthetic codes for benchmarking, or
for trace generation using OTF2.

List of benchmarks:
  * Pairs: multi-pairs message exchange
  * Spread: k-neighbor communication within rankspace neighborhood
  * Unstr-mesh: unstructured mesh communication pattern
