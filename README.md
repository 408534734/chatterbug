Communication Proxies
===========

Set of communication-only codes that mimic commonly found communication patterns
in HPC codes. These codes can be used as synthetic codes for benchmarking, or
for trace generation (using OTF2 or BigSim.

Refer to READY_BENCHMARKS files for the list of benchmarks that are ready for
use.
